Breadth-First Search (BFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores all the vertices of a graph in breadth-first order. It starts at a given vertex and explores all the vertices at the same level before moving to the next level. The algorithm works as follows:1. Initialize a queue to store the vertices to be visited. Add the starting vertex to the queue.2. Initialize a visited set to keep track of the visited vertices. Add the starting vertex to the visited set.3. While the queue is not empty, do the following:   a. Dequeue a vertex from the queue.   b. Visit the dequeued vertex and process it as needed.   c. Enqueue all the adjacent vertices of the dequeued vertex that have not been visited yet.   d. Add the newly enqueued vertices to the visited set.4. Repeat step 3 until the queue is empty.The BFS algorithm ensures that all the vertices are visited in the shortest possible path from the starting vertex. It is commonly used to find the shortest path between two vertices in an unweighted graph. The time complexity of BFS is O(V+E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges in the graph. The space complexity is also O(V+E) as it uses a queue to store the vertices to be visited and a visited set to keep track of the visited vertices.
