Depth-First Search (DFS) is a graph traversal algorithm that explores the deepest paths of a graph or tree first. It starts at a given vertex and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.DFS is commonly used in many applications such as finding connected components, detecting cycles, and solving maze problems. It is also used in artificial intelligence and machine learning for tasks such as pathfinding and decision-making.The algorithm works by maintaining a stack of vertices to be visited. It starts by visiting the initial vertex and marking it as visited. Then, it explores each of its neighbors in turn, marking them as visited and adding them to the stack. It continues this process until it reaches a dead end, at which point it backtracks to the previous vertex and continues exploring from there.DFS can be implemented using either recursion or an explicit stack. Recursion is often used for its simplicity, but it can lead to stack overflow errors for large graphs. An explicit stack can handle larger graphs, but it requires more memory and is more complex to implement.Overall, DFS is a powerful algorithm that can efficiently explore the structure of a graph or tree. Its applications are numerous, and it is an essential tool for many fields of study.
