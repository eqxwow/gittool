Binary search is a searching algorithm that is used to find a specific element in a sorted array or list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the desired element is found or the search interval is empty. The algorithm starts by comparing the target element with the middle element of the array. If the target element is equal to the middle element, the search is complete. If the target element is greater than the middle element, the search continues in the right half of the array. If the target element is less than the middle element, the search continues in the left half of the array. This process is repeated until the target element is found or the search interval is empty. Binary search is a very efficient algorithm with a time complexity of O(log n), which means that it can search large arrays or lists very quickly. However, it can only be used on sorted arrays or lists, and it may not be the best choice for small arrays or lists.
